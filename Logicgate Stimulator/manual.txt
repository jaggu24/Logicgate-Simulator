Welcome to the logic gate stimulator
You can create a logic gate and test it by giving inputs 
You can create any kind of combinational circuits using
1.And
2.Or
3.Not
4.Nand
5.Nor
6.XOR
7.XNOR
8.Encoder
9.Decoder
10.Multiplexer
11.Demultiplexer
->You can test your inputs or generate the truth table for the created gate
->Before Generating your gate you must draw your gate in a sheet of paper and number the inputs,gates and the
   output of gates
->First you need to enter your dummy inputs for the generation of the gate
->Then choose the gates option to create your desired gate
->you need to map the inputs to the input of the gate using the input number
->You can also sgive the output of a previous gate as a input by selecting the old option and specifying the 
  output number
->After constructing the gates u can see the desired outputs by choosing the display option 
  Then specify the output number 
->you can again check with different inputs or generate a truth table from the input values which you have 
  specified

 Now you proceed for making the logic gate
